# Data Structures & Types

Working with JavaScript's built-in data structures and types.

## Key Concepts
- **Arrays**: Built-in methods and manipulation.
- **Destructuring**: Unpacking values from arrays or properties from objects.
- **Reference vs Value**: Understanding how data is stored and copied.
- **Coercion**: Implicit and explicit type conversion.

## Deep Dive

### Coercion

Type coercion is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another (such as strings to numbers). Type conversion is similar to type coercion because they both convert values from one data type to another with one key difference — type coercion is implicit whereas type conversion can be either implicit or explicit.
